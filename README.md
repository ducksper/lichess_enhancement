<p align="center">♟️ New pieces, boards and sounds for <a href="https://lichess.org">lichess.org</a>, including the chess.com styles.</p>

---

## Features

- **61 piece sets** — chess.com (2D and 3D), Chessfactory, Maurizio Monge, and community sets (Amogus, Doge, Pony…)
- **33 board themes** — chess.com boards plus a few extras
- **10 sound sets** — replaces the lichess move / capture / check / checkmate sounds with chess.com sound themes
- A **preview page** showing every piece set and board (link inside the popup)

Everything is configured from the extension popup and applies immediately to the active lichess tab.

## Installation

### Chrome / Edge / Brave

Install from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lichess-enhancement/ikmpcihcohdjammgkopfgohojdelmfoi) — the listing is maintained from this repository.

Store review can make the listing lag a few days behind this repo. To run the latest version right away, install it unpacked:

1. Download the repo (**Code → Download ZIP**) and unzip it, or `git clone` it.
2. Open `chrome://extensions` and enable **Developer mode** (top right).
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the extension folder.

### Firefox

Install from [Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/enhancement-lichess/) — the extension is reviewed and signed by Mozilla. Requires Firefox 140+ (desktop and Android).

Firefox treats host permissions as opt-in: open the popup and click **Grant access to lichess.org** the first time (the banner only appears while access is missing).

AMO review can make the listing lag a few days behind this repo. To run the latest version right away, load it temporarily: open `about:debugging` → **This Firefox** → **Load Temporary Add-on** and pick `manifest.json`.

## How it works

- **Pieces and boards**: a content script injects a stylesheet on lichess pages that overrides the piece sprites (`piece.<color>.<role>`) and the board texture (`cg-board::before`) with images bundled in the extension.
- **Sounds**: `declarativeNetRequest` rules redirect the lichess sound files (`Move`, `Capture`, `Check`, `Checkmate`) to the mp3 files of the selected sound set. No network request leaves the extension: everything is served locally.

## Contributing

Bug reports and new sets are welcome — open an [issue](https://github.com/basedpolymer/lichess_enhancement/issues) or a pull request. To add a piece set, drop 12 files named `bb, bk, bn, bp, bq, br, wb, wk, wn, wp, wq, wr` (`.webp`) in `ressources/pieces/<set_name>/` (lowercase folder name), then add the matching `<option>` in `index.html` and a row in `ressources/preview/index.html`. Convert a PNG losslessly with `ffmpeg -i wq.png -c:v libwebp -lossless 1 wq.webp`. `scripts/downloadStylesFromChesscom.py` can help fetching chess.com styles.
